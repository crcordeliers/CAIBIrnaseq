This `params.yml` file is used to configure the unsupervised RNA-seq analysis pipeline. It allows users to specify settings for clustering, filtering, normalization, and visualization of their RNA-seq dataset. Below, each parameter is explained in detail to help guide you in filling out or understanding this configuration.

## Structure of `params.yml`

The file is formatted in YAML, which makes it easy to read and edit. Below, we break down the purpose of each parameter.

### Project Information

#### `project`

-   **Description**: A descriptive name for the project.
-   **Example**: `Mouse STING KO`
-   **Usage**: This will be used as the title of the analysis report to identify the project.

#### `data_file`

-   **Description**: Path to the RNA-seq data file in `.RDS` format.
-   **Example**: `data/STING_KO/exp_data.RDS`
-   **Usage**: This should point to the expression data file that you wish to analyze. The `.RDS` file contains your pre-processed gene expression matrix.

#### `use_symbol`

-   **Description**: Whether to convert gene identifiers to gene symbols.
-   **Options**: `true` or `false`
-   **Example**: `true`
-   **Usage**: Set to `true` to rebase Ensembl IDs to gene symbols, which can make downstream analysis and interpretation easier for biological studies.

#### `show_code`

-   **Description**: Whether to display the code in the output report.
-   **Options**: `true` or `false`
-   **Example**: `false`
-   **Usage**: Set this to `true` if you want to include R code in the final output report, which may help for reproducibility or educational purposes.

### Species Information

#### `species`

-   **Description**: Specifies the species of the dataset.
-   **Example**: `Mus musculus`
-   **Usage**: This parameter helps select the appropriate gene sets and pathways for the analysis. Here, `Mus musculus` (mouse) is specified.

### Plot Annotations

#### `plot_annotations`

-   **Description**: Metadata fields used to color-code plots.
-   **Example**: `Genotype`
-   **Usage**: Specify metadata that can be used to annotate or differentiate groups in visualizations, such as PCA or clustering plots.

### Quality Control (QC)

#### `qc`

This section contains quality control thresholds to filter the dataset.

-   **`min_nsamp`**: Minimum number of samples a gene must be expressed in to be retained.
    -   **Example**: `2`
    -   **Usage**: Genes expressed in fewer than this number of samples are removed to reduce noise.
-   **`min_gene_counts`**: Minimum count for a gene to be retained.
    -   **Example**: `1`
    -   **Usage**: Genes with fewer counts than this threshold will be filtered out. This helps remove low-expression, noisy genes.

### Clustering Configuration

#### `exp_cluster`

-   **`k`**: Number of clusters for unsupervised clustering of expression data.
    -   **Example**: `2`
    -   **Usage**: Defines how many groups the samples will be clustered into based on expression patterns.

#### `metadata_clusters`

-   **Description**: Controls clustering based on metadata scores, like pathway activity or microenvironment composition.
-   **`pathway_scores`**: Defines the number of clusters (`k`) for clustering samples based on pathway activity scores.
    -   **Example**: `k: 2`
-   **`microenv_scores`**: Defines the number of clusters (`k`) for clustering based on microenvironment scores.
    -   **Example**: `k: 3`

### Pathway Collections

#### `pathway_collections`

-   **Description**: Defines which pathway collections to use for pathway activity scoring.
-   **Example**: `CP:KEGG`
-   **Usage**: Here, the `CP:KEGG` collection from MSigDB is used. You can choose different collections based on your research question.

       Pms2, Pold1, Pold2, Pold3, Pold4, Rfc1, Rfc2, Rfc3,
       Rfc4, Rfc5, Rpa1, Rpa2, Rpa3, Ssbp1],
      KEGG_CITRATE_CYCLE_TCA_CYCLE
    ]
    ```

-   **Usage**: Provide either a list of specific genes or pathways to be used for heatmap visualizations. This allows you to focus on specific areas of interest.

## Editing Tips

1.  **YAML Formatting**: YAML is indentation-sensitive, so make sure to use consistent spacing to avoid syntax errors.
2.  **Commenting**: You can add comments using `#` to document specific settings or notes.
3.  **Validation**: Double-check file paths, gene names, and pathway names to ensure they match the data to avoid errors during analysis.

## Common Issues

-   **Incorrect Paths**: Make sure the `data_file` path is correct so the program can locate the dataset.
-   **Missing Values**: Parameters must be properly filled in; any missing required parameters can cause the analysis to fail.
-   **Formatting Errors**: Incorrect indentation in YAML can lead to parsing issues—be mindful of spacing.
