# CAIBIrnaseq

**CAIBIrnaseq** is an R package developed by the CAIBI platform for the supervised and unsupervised analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.

It provides a complete pipeline for preprocessing, quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, pathway analysis, and data visualization. This package is designed to be flexible and integrates seamlessly with popular bioinformatics tools like `DESeq2`, `GSVA`, and `MCPcounter`.

## üîß Installation

As **CAIBIrnaseq** package is available on Github, you will need to install devtools:  
`install.packages("devtools")`

Then then you can try execute this command :   
`devtools::install_github("your-research-center/CAIBIrnaseq")`

üïí There is a lot of dependencies, so the installation might take some time (~40min) ...


This package uses non-CRAN dependencies so it may cause some problems.

If you have an error in the package's installation of the dependency 'ggheatmapper', you can do this command before in the console :   
`if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))`
  `install.packages("BiocManager")`
`BiocManager::install("ggtree")`

The package is made to only require this command to work :   
`devtools::install_github("your-research-center/CAIBIrnaseq")`

There may be problems installing dependencies. The Console will tell you which packages are missing. Do not hesitate to install the missing packages manually. It may be easier and faster. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions
About the available functions, there are different types of functions : pre-processing functions, plot functions (heatmaps, boxplots), scores functions, pathway functions, cluster functions...

For each function, documentation is available with some precision about the parameters and the function's utility.
