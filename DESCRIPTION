Description: This package provides tools for both supervised and unsupervised analysis of RNA sequencing data, specifically for bulk RNA-seq experiments. It includes functions for data preprocessing, quality control, normalization, clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), pathway analysis, and visualization. The package is designed to handle complex RNA-seq datasets, offering various methods for analyzing gene expression, pathway enrichment, and differential expression.
