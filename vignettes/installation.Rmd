This guide explains how to install the **CAIBIrnaseq** package from GitHub, including required dependencies and system setup.


# System setup

## R version

This package is available for R version above the 4.1.0.
Verify your version with :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
version
```

## System dependencies

For some systems, there are command lines to run in the **Terminal** so that the system has all the dependencies to install correctly the package.

### Linux Ubuntu/Debian

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# Upgrade of the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# System dependencies
sudo apt install -y r-base r-base-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libgit2-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev build-essential zlib1g-dev pandoc git
```

### MacOS

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# If not already done, install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# System dependencies 
brew install libgit2 pkg-config freetype harfbuzz fribidi libpng libtiff jpeg pandoc git
```

### Windows 

For Windows, you must only install `Rtools` (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
Then, restart Rstudio and verify `Rtools` is installed :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# In R Console
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```


# Packages to install before CAIBIrnaseq

To install the **CAIBIrnaseq** package from GitHub, you have to install 2 basic packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If not already installed
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("BiocManager")
```

`devtools` will allows us to install the package from Github 
`BiocManager` to install the **Bioconductor** dependencies. 


# Installation of CAIBIrnaseq

Now, you are ready to install the package !
Just run this line : 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Installation from Github : 
devtools::install_github("crcordeliers/CAIBIrnaseq", dependencies = TRUE)
```

There is a lot of packages, so the installation might take a bit of time...

When you are done, verify that the package is installed correctly : 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(CAIBIrnaseq)
```

If you do not encounter any errors, you're DONE !

Hope this package will help you in your projects !!!


# Issues

As there is a lot of packages, you could encounter some difficulties to install the package. Normally, the installation of `devtools` and `BiocManager` should be enough, but if you have missing packages, do not hesitate to install manually the missing ones. 

You might have difficulties with `DESeq2` and `SummarizedExperiment` packages. Just try running these command lines :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Manual installation
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment")
```

If the errors persist, check that you have all system dependencies and write permissions in the folder where the libraries are installed.
