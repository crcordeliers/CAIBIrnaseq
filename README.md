## ðŸŽ¯ Welcome to CAIBIrnaseq <img src="man/figures/CAIBI.png" align="right" alt="CAIBIrnaseq logo" width="120" />

**CAIBIrnaseq** is an R package designed to streamline, standardize, and reproduce key steps of gene expression analysis from RNA-seq data. Developed by the **CAIBI platform team**, it integrates powerful tools for:

- **Preprocessing** raw expression data (TPM calculation, filtering, normalization, etc.)
- **Exploratory data analysis** (PCA, clustering, heatmaps)
- **Differential expression analysis** (DESeq2 and visualization of DE genes)
- **Functional and pathway analysis** (FGSEA, ORA, PROGENy scoring)
- **Tumor microenvironment investigation** (MCPcounter, cell-type signatures)

Whether you are a **biologist**, **bioinformatician**, or **data scientist**, **CAIBIrnaseq** provides a **turnkey solution** for interpreting your transcriptomic datasets in a reproducible and insightful way.

**We hope this will help you in your projects !**
