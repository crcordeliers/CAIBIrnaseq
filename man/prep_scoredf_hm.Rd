\title{Prepare Pathway Scores Data Frame for Heatmap}
\usage{
prep_scoredf_hm(pathway_scores, pathways = 1:20)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_scores}{A matrix or data frame with pathway scores (rows = pathways, columns = samples).}

\item{pathways}{Either a numeric vector of row indices or a character vector of pathway names to include. Default is 1:20.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{table}{A data frame in wide format (samples in rows, pathways in columns) with `sample_id` as row identifier.}
  \item{colv}{The column name to use as sample ID (`"sample_id"`).}
  \item{rowv}{A character vector of selected pathway names.}
}
}
\description{
This function prepares a data frame of pathway scores, transposed and ready for
heatmap visualization. It filters and selects a subset of pathways, either by
name or index.
