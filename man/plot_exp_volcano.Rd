\title{Plot Volcano Plot of Differential Expression Results}
\usage{
plot_exp_volcano(diffexp)
}
\arguments{
\item{diffexp}{A data frame containing differential expression results. Must include the following columns:
- `log2FoldChange`: The log2 fold change values for each gene.
- `padj`: The adjusted p-value for each gene.}
}
\value{
A `plotly` object representing the interactive volcano plot.
}
\description{
Generates an interactive volcano plot based on the results of differential expression analysis, highlighting upregulated and downregulated genes.
}
\details{
This function creates a volcano plot that visualizes the significance and fold change of genes from differential expression analysis. Genes are categorized as:
- "Upregulated": padj < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 1
- "Downregulated": padj < 0.05 and log2FoldChange < -1

The plot includes:
- Horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicating thresholds for significance (padj < 0.05) and fold change (log2FoldChange of Â±1).
- Top 20 significant genes based on padj are labeled interactively.

The output is an interactive plot created with `plotly`, allowing for tooltips that display gene-specific information.
