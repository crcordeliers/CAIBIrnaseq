\title{Prepare Pathway Scores for Heatmap Visualization}
\usage{
prep_scores_hm(exp_data, pathway_scores, pathways = 1:20)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp_data}{A `SummarizedExperiment` object containing sample annotations in `colData`.}

\item{pathway_scores}{A matrix or data frame with pathway scores (rows = pathways, columns = samples).}

\item{pathways}{Either a numeric vector indicating indices of pathways to include, or a character vector of pathway names. Default is 1:20.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{table}{A data frame in wide format with pathway scores and sample metadata.}
  \item{colv}{Column to use as identifier for samples (usually `"sample_id"`).}
  \item{rowv}{A character vector of selected pathways.}
}
}
\description{
This function prepares a tidy table of pathway scores joined with sample annotations
from a `SummarizedExperiment` object. It returns a list suitable for heatmap plotting.
