\title{Estimate Transcripts Per Million (TPM)}
\usage{
estimateTPM(exp, gene_lengths)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A numeric matrix or data frame of raw expression counts. Rows represent genes, columns represent samples.}

\item{gene_lengths}{A numeric vector of gene lengths (in kilobases or base pairs) corresponding to the rows of \code{exp}.
Must be the same length as the number of rows in \code{exp}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of TPM-normalized expression values with the same dimensions as \code{exp}.
}
\description{
This function calculates TPM values from raw expression counts and gene lengths.
TPM is a normalization method that accounts for both sequencing depth and gene length,
allowing comparison of gene expression levels within and between samples.
