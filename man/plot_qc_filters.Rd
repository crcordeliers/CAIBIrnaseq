\title{Plot QC Filters for Gene Expression Data}
\usage{
plot_qc_filters(
  gexp,
  fname = "results/qc/plot_QC_filters.pdf",
  min_nfeats = 5000,
  min_ncounts = 5e+06,
  out = c("plotly", "ggplot")[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gexp}{A `SummarizedExperiment` object containing gene expression data. The `colData` must include `nfeats` (number of detected features) and `ncounts` (total counts per sample).}

\item{fname}{A character string specifying the file path to save the plot as a PDF. Default is `"results/qc/plot_QC_filters.pdf"`. Set to `NULL` to skip saving.}

\item{min_nfeats}{An integer specifying the minimum number of features for a sample to pass QC. Default is `5000`.}

\item{min_ncounts}{A numeric value specifying the minimum total counts for a sample to pass QC. Default is `5e6`.}

\item{out}{A character string indicating the output type: `"plotly"` (interactive Plotly plot) or `"ggplot"` (static ggplot). Default is `"plotly"`.}
}
\value{
A QC plot, either as a `plotly` interactive object or a `ggplot` static object, depending on the `out` parameter.
}
\description{
This function creates a quality control (QC) plot for a `SummarizedExperiment` object, highlighting samples that pass or fail specified QC thresholds.
}
\details{
The function identifies samples that fail QC based on thresholds for the number of detected features (`min_nfeats`) and total counts (`min_ncounts`). It creates a scatter plot with:
- The x-axis representing the number of features (`nfeats`).
- The y-axis representing the total counts (`ncounts`).
- Points color-coded based on QC status (`pass` or `fail`).
- Dashed lines indicating the QC thresholds.

If `out = "plotly"`, the plot is interactive, allowing for sample tooltips. If a file name (`fname`) is provided, the static ggplot is saved as a PDF.
